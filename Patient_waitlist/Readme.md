### Introduction
The dataset captures information on the total number of patients who had to wait for their treatments.
* Timeframe: Data is archived and aggregated at the end of each month.
* Waiting Time Bands: The dataset categorizes patients into different waiting time bands, showing the duration they had to wait for their treatments.
* Patient Count: The number of patients within each waiting time band is recorded.
* Categorization:
> * Treatment Specialties: Data is categorized based on different medical treatment specialties (e.g., cardiology, orthopedics, among others).
> * Case Type: It differentiates between various case types (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, and day case).
> * Age Group: Patients are further categorized by age group, providing insights into the age distribution of waiting times.
